Students perform best scores in PISA, and teachers report the importance of systemic reform to the traditional schooling approach.: ""Finland exemplifies the principle of slow schooling described by Honoré (2004) as leading patiently to sustainable success (also Hargreaves and Fink, 2006), compared to the rush to raise test scores quickly."" (OECD,2007) Finland, like all Nordic countries, values lifelong learning and therefore has no standardized or high stakes testing method and therefore does not devote resources and time to test production and preparation (Sahlberg, 2006). Instead, it has a broad curriculum that is not preoccupied with tested basics. Maths and sciences are essential for business and economic development, but so are artistic and other forms of creativity that have long contributed to the Finnish school identity. As a result, Finland promotes quality learning and records the lowest high dropout rates. Finland committed to reforming the traditional system by improving and developing the curricular steering system, achieved through shared values, high participation, and widespread cooperation via curricular reform. Furthermore, Finland has demonstrated a solid commitment to inclusive, equal, and innovative social ideals both outside and within the educational system. Therefore, the prevention of dropout rates and promoting quality learning passes through restructuring the school pedagogically to promote school success.Prime school, instead of following the industrial traditional model, where classrooms resemble a fabric, the school believes that there is always space for improvement.Dropping out of school and early schooling leaving were seen as a certain inevitability dependent, above all, on the children's inability to learn, on the young people's lack of interest in Education, or on the (non) willingness of families to keep their children in school, therefore it was considered as a phenomenon that did not depend on school organization, pedagogical methods, teacher qualifications or national and local policies brought to the field by the management of schools. Nevertheless, through various studies and throughout the years the consensus, is becoming more evident that the pedagogical practices are key to avoiding dropout rates and ensuring an inclusive approach. For example, in a study conducted by Mohlouoa (2014), the dropout rates were not strongly linked with social and economic conditions; instead, the pedagogical approach played a major role.Since Prime School believes that every child has the right to a second opportunity, the school follows a non-retention policy, where all students are incentivized to reach their full potential. Therefore, Prime school opts for a different pedagogical approach where practices intend to put the student in the center, customizing the curriculum to fit the best needs of each and every student. The pedagogical board in Prime school is composed of a group of educational researchers to guarantee and ensure that education is delivered in the best quality possible.The democratization of Education leads eventually to the massification of Education. Massification of Education is supported by the assumption that only the one-size-fits-all approach would guarantee equality for all. The problem is not that we must have a school for all. Instead, it is the wrong idea that school should be the same for all, since students are heterogeneous, and they don’t learn in the same way. Finland, for example, as the role model of Education, refused to engage in the principle of Massification. Massification as the ""equality temptation"" represents one of the major causes of school failure and early school leaving. (Silva & Pinto, 2016). The aim is to prevent students from disconnecting from school, promote school success, and ensure the quality of learning. Prime school delivers a student-centered approach in order to combat the one-size-fits-all as a means of learning.In Portugal the educational model is centralized, therefore public schools cannot manage the curriculum. While in Prime School, an International private school follows the Cambridge curriculum and it possesses a certain degree of autonomy to adapt the curriculum according to the student's capacities and desires. For the reasons presented above, the Pedagogical Director of Prime School, Edite Reina, makes quality education and inclusion a priority for 21st-century students, in accordance with the UN SDGs 2030.The school of the 21st century questions its place as a space for the construction of knowledge. The reflection on the demands and urgencies of compulsory schooling of twelve years in a liquid world, in constant change, announces a paradigm transformation about school success. Teaching in the middle of the digital age contributes to creating ""never-before-seen opportunities to make teaching a passionate and motivating profession that makes a difference for a future society. Such opportunities are related to new roles, new content and new teaching and learning methods"".  From the most recently produced reflections, new goals were announced, skills to be acquired by students - the 4 C's (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity) gave way to 6 C's - critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, citizenship, personality (Fullan & Geoff Scott, 2014).In 2009, the European Council established a strategic framework for European cooperation in the field of Education and training, agreeing, by 2020:Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality. Improve the quality and effectiveness of Education and training.Promote equality, social cohesion, and active citizenship. Encourage creativity and innovation, including the entrepreneurial spirit, at all levels of Education and training.The document stresses that lifelong learning should be considered a fundamental principle. It should include learning in all contexts (formal, non-formal, and informal) and at all levels: from pre-school and school Education to higher Education, vocational education and training, and adult education. Prime school offers vocational training if the students are committed to taking a step forward. In the last decade, worldwide educational innovation has driven new practices that impact and improve students' motivation and learning. Examples are Finland and the network of Jesuit schools in Barcelona. Prime school follows such examples and disrupts the traditional classroom model where the teacher debits and the students reproduce, with the PBL approach students have the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge acquired in the classroom and apply it to real-life situations closer to what will be faced when entering the labor market.The importance of pre-school and teacher training is highlighted, one of the main actors of change. In Prime School, a change that integrates new ways of organizing class groups, schedules, and disciplines and spaces, which have been adapted to new organizational forms is in place. The teacher-student ratio corresponds to 1-5. ""They conceive school activities in larger groups, from 2 to 3 basic classes, with the respective teachers teaching at the same time, sometimes working with all students, sometimes breaking down into different groups, with variable geometry, according to the type of activity in progress the pace of learning and carrying out activities, and also according to the projects in execution"". -Amanda Santos, Marketing TeacherPrime school takes a student-centered approach:In short, it is at school that qualitative and sustainable change may or may not happen, regardless of what is enacted. And it is at the level of the classroom or the (which can be multiple) and what teachers do with student teaching-learning moments that change can occur, if teachers duly supported, duly clarified and able to inform, feeling part of a professional culture that reflected, dialogue and discussed common goals of according to the diversity of students it has, and which concluded the need for change in structure. “A school change is multidimensional, involving the purpose, the structure, the culture, politics, continuous learning, and discreet administration (...) everything affects everything else '' (Hargreaves, Earl, and Ryan, 1996). If education plays a major role in social change, it will be no less true that social changes call for a rethinking of education. But, unfortunately, the successive reforms applied had little influence on teaching practices. Therefore, having seen the failure of some supposed innovations in the organization of teaching, evidenced in the continuation of retentions, school dropout, demotivation of students and teachers, it is urgent to think again and in continuity, the importance of the “School” and its practices.Prime school wants to revolutionize the education system in place and it's reflected on the results of students. The majority of Prime school students have access to the world's best universitiesFurthermore, if the examples from schools that dared to change the current models resulted in the promotion of school success, it is advisable to think about the changes necessary for success to occur in our educational contexts.Curriculum as the GamechangerPrime school believes that Portugal needs a school where pedagogical stagnation does not recur and where better results are obtained. ""The curriculum and the way it is managed can be decisive in this process”, referring to the process of improving the schooling system in Portugal.“In our school where innovation takes place, (…) in a logic of continuous professional development, and assuming shared and collective responsibility for the learning process of all students) Teachers assume themselves as builders and not mere executors of the curriculum, a sine qua non condition for implementing pedagogical innovations leading to relevant improvements in their students' learning."" -Gabrielle Parrinha, Pedagogical SecretariatCurriculum reform became in the past decade the primary focus for Education reform in Europe. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)   released a study in 2012 named ""Curriculum reform in Europe and the impact of learning outcomes”. It concluded that curricula reform can benefit both the teachers and students and that making changes to the curriculum resulted in more effective and meaningful learning and teaching. The literature surrounding curriculum development and innovation suggests that dissemination (curriculum) occupies a central role in the process of change. (Fullan, 2008)""In the face of an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, education can make the difference as to whether people embrace the challenges they are confronted with or whether they defeat them. And in an era characterized by a new explosion of scientific knowledge and a growing array of complex societal problems, it is appropriate that curricula should continue to evolve, perhaps in radical ways."" (OECD,2018)Materializing the changeInclusive education and curricular reform are key towards the aim to promote school success, which Prime School aims to achieve. Several studies have been carried out in order to grasp the effectiveness of promoting school inclusion through curricular reform. Inclusion demands curricular flexibility since not all students learn the same way. The “one-size-fits-all” approach becomes obsolete and contributes to school dropout rates and early school abandonment. (Rafo & Gunter, 2008)The commitment to inclusive education, as described in ""Policy guidance on inclusion in education"" by UNESCO (2009) it’s a process aimed at responding to the diversity of pupils' needs by expanding the involvement and participation of all in learning and the life of the school community, was reaffirmed by Portugal's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol, which was adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on December 13, 2006.  In Portugal, it was approved by Assembly Resolution 56/2009 on July 30, ratified by Presidential Decree 71/2009, and reaffirmed in the ""Lisbon Declaration on Educational Equity"" in July 2015. This pledge also aims to achieve the UN Agenda 2030's sustainable development goals. Portugal, therefore, elaborated the document “Students Profile for the 21st century”, a guiding matrix of current decisions regarding the educational process: Framed in the recommendations of the European Union, in the international documents of the OECD Education Project 2030,  and Education 2030 Framework for Action, by UNESCO, which Prime School International pays close attention to, in order to implement it in the school's policy. The Portuguese Ministry of Education established a student profile after leaving compulsory education defining a frame of reference that presupposes their freedom, responsibility, appreciation of work, self-awareness, family and community insertion, and participation in a rapidly changing society. The document explains principles, vision, values, competencies, and learnings. Some principles that underlie curricular work are listed:Establishing a humanistic base profile, understanding knowledge as fundamental to the construction of a society centered on human beings and their dignity.Contribute to sustainable development; put reality at the center of learning through flexible curriculum management; develop adaptability and boldness.Guarantee stability so that the system adapts. The reformulations take effect, placing the school at the center of the valorization of knowledge through the awakening and promotion of intellectual curiosity.How does Prime school put it into practice?Prime School makes the Student Profile for the 21st Century, a priority:Address each area of ​​knowledge's contents to situations and problems present in the student's daily life or present in the socio-cultural and geographical environment in which it operates, using materials and diversified resources. Organize teaching by providing experimentation with techniques, diversified instruments, and forms of work, promoting intentionally, in the classroom or outside, observation activities, questioning reality and integrating knowledge. Organize and develop cooperative learning activities oriented towards the integration and exchange of knowledge, awareness raising themselves, others and the environment, and realizing projects out of school. Organize teaching by providing critical use of information sources and information and communication technologies. Promote systematically and intentionally, in the classroom and outside, activities that allow students to make choices, confront points of view, solve problems, and make decisions based on values.Create spaces and times at school for students to intervene freely and responsibly. To value, in the evaluation of the student's learning, the work of the free initiative, encouraging positive intervention in the school environment and community (DGES, 2017)The role of the TeacherThis section starts to present the Teacher’s importance and the necessary commitment to comply with the expectations of the Prime school and implement them. The teacher is the primary agent for curriculum reform since the teachers and school leaders are responsible for designing it. Therefore, this section will analyze the teaching profession and its impacts on curriculum design and implementation.The methodology for infallible student success continues to be discussed over the years, and no conclusion yet has been reached. However, a consensus that ""The traditional forms of teaching are now obsolete” (Cardoso, 2013) starts to be pointed out. The methodology that accompanied the school fixed in the classrooms for several years should be reconsidered since it marginalized those who could not learn (Robinson & Aronica, 2010). Prime school takes the opportunity to reform the traditional model's classroom layout, considered archaic, although it is still timeless in many classrooms.There is a vast range of strategies to achieve student success, enforce programs, acquire skills and values, and teach according to the profiles in a didactic, active and individualized way. However, there is no methodology or strategy for school success capable of covering all student profiles since its application/implementation determines that the actor-teachers balance and act rationally in each particular context. The teacher's work goes beyond the classroom and the act of teaching and correcting tests. Portugal and other European countries have currently changed teaching methodologies at the school, attempting to promote students' success. The teacher must remember that they represent “a model of conduct and civics for students"", and therefore, the more culture he demonstrates, the more captive and more competent they will be, thus giving the teacher ""an added responsibility”. In short, ""when students appreciate a teacher and trust him, they like to know her/his opinion on issues that go beyond the strict classroom materials"" (Cardoso, 2013).In Prime school, the teacher does not only guide, accompany, and motivate the student, but teachers should also be responsible for developing students’ skills “such as cooperation, research and the ability to debate,” as defended by Cohen & Fradique (2018). Therefore, teachers create the curriculum in co-authorship with other teachers, focusing on the students' cognitive characteristics. Throughout the process, they should do the ""setting of objectives, selection, and integration of contents; design of teaching strategies, operationalization of activities, streamlining and organization of resources and teaching materials; guidance and monitoring of students and appropriation of evaluation criteria” (Cohen & Fradique, 2018). Lifelong learning and the autonomy to do so is one of the objectives of implementing the student's profile after leaving mandatory schooling principles: ""education must intentionally promote the development of the ability to learn, the basis of lifelong learning"" (Martins et al., 2017). Therefore, in addition to adequate the changes and adaptations that the teacher must have throughout his professional career, according to Martins et al. (2017), the teacher must also perform some actions that linked with the areas of competence of the profile of the student, such as: promoting activities that allow students to master and express the various forms of expression and communication associated with ""language, literature, music, arts, technologies, mathematics and science"".In Prime School, the professors build the annual plan at the end of the school year (July). The class professors accompany them from the previous year, and the teachers of each course are allocated, purposely, for the project sessions. In this meeting, they define, through the agglutinating theme, the sub-themes, and subjects they intend to work on. Throughout the year, once a week, the teachers are supposed to meet to discuss the next week and use an informal group on social networks to stay in touch or finalize some details after school time, stipulated for planning.Implementing Curricular ChangesAutonomy and curriculum flexibility is helpful to schools seeking to create collaborative planning time for teachers. At the same time, however, these efforts invite technical complexities (e.g., structure school time, arranging interdisciplinary learning when designing curriculum flexibility…)To implement curricular changes, teachers must develop foundational professional practices that help them achieve new curricular and pedagogical goals. By defining, developing, and enacting these new practices over time, teachers can continually improve their practices. Some of the foundational Portuguese’s methods that teachers could benefit from cultivating and sustaining include:Prioritizing student learning and engagement Developing a culture of learning, trust, creativity and thoughtful risk-taking (Guin, 2004)regularly practising faculty collaboration, student collaboration, reflection and action to improve teaching practices, and engaging and building partnerships with community members and other stakeholders (Darling-Hammond & Richardson, 2009).These practices are vital and they are central for Prime School. Cultivating foundational professional practices that enable teachers and students to exercise autonomy and flexibility takes time. For example, interdisciplinary learning requires teachers in different subject areas to collaborate and learn from each other to find content areas that are amenable to merging. It requires students and teachers to learn and reflect and iterate their practices (Harris & Jones, 2020). Thus, new pedagogical and curricular practices take time to develop and implement, which started 20 years ago when the school was created.ConclusionPrime school: Core activities and benefitsIntensive Music and Arts  Vocational training and accompaniment through the Career ProgrammesCambridge CurriculumOur multicultural school engages in inclusion and the benefits of a bilingual education Wide scope of teaching and learningTeachers are mentors and not figures of authorityStrong pedagogical and educational researchersopenness to foster the development of the best education for the studentMix approach between Project-based learning approach and a Student-centered approachTeacher-student ratio: 1-7 studentsextracurricular activities programmeICT enthusiast   An innovative approach for the students Project-Based Learning  Alexandre Rüffer  Read Next          Powered by Odoo  Copyright © Prime School -     Terms of use -     Privacy Policy -     Legal Advice      Powered by Odoo,     the #1 Open Source eCommerce.

This curriculum is considered by us to be the best that fits in with its philosophy, besides its international recognition and great prestige for its student-centered approach. We have been following this teaching method since 2006, adding to the value of 21st-century education, the investment in the future of our planet through our students. The Cambridge International Curriculum sets a global standard for education and is recognized by Universities and Employers worldwide. Our curriculum is flexible, challenging and inspiring, culturally sensitive, yet international in approach. Cambridge students develop an informed curiosity and a lasting passion for learning. They also gain the essential skills they need for success at university and in their future careers. Aims  The overarching aim of the Cambridge Curriculum is to promote a high standard of British Education.   Over 10,000 schools in over 160 countries follow the Cambridge International Curriculum. The curriculum is international in philosophy and approach, but is flexible to be tailored to local contexts. Cambridge students towards Cambridge International qualifications, which are globally accepted and recognized. Cambridge students who move between Cambridge Schools, can continue their studies following the same Curriculum.  International Recognition  Over 1,400 Universities worldwide recognize Cambridge qualifications. They are accepted by all British universities, 600 American universities, as well as in many other leading academic destinations, such as Portugal, Canada, Australia, Singapore, South Africa, Germany, the Netherlands, etc. Universities and Employers recognize their qualifications as evidence of academic achievement. They appreciate that the demand for our curriculum and the rigor of our assessments equip students with the tools necessary to flourish in Higher Education.    Preschool -   Start Of A New Life  This stage is about far more than colors and shapes, numbers and letters. This is the stage in which your child lays the foundations for academia, developing his/her independence, confidence, resilience and curiosity. It’s an exciting time for children and parents alike, as school life takes off. As parents, we can feel anxious about our child starting ‘big school’ – will they adapt to a bigger class and larger premises? Will they make friends easily? But children are flexible and very soon adjust to their exciting new environment.  Year 01 -   Light-Touch Learning & Plenty Of Fun!  Leaving Preschool behind and moving onto Year 01, can feel like a major step for a children and his parents. Your child’s Homeroom teacher is there to facilitate this transition, by supporting pupils and their parents. Year 01 teachers comment on how pupils return from their summer break appearing more grown up, wiser and ready for a challenge. In this phase, pupils are still learning through playing, exploring, discovering, and enjoying role-playing. Your child’s day will be a little more structured than it was in Preschool, and he/she may have to sit at a table for a little longer than they are used to, but they will be learning in a variety of ways - while moving, exploring the outdoors, in groups, on the carpet, or walking around the school!  What Will My Child Do In Year 01?  This is the first year of the Cambridge Curriculum. Like all year groups, Year 01 has government statutory schemes of learning to comply with. All children are supported in their development and are given extra support and guidance if needed. There is a Year 01 phonics screening test in June, which helps your child’s Homeroom teacher to identify if he/she is secure in pronouncing and blending graphemes. It also detects if they can read phonically decodable words. Don’t be concerned about formal evaluation: the Homeroom teacher will assess your child daily and will have identified any areas they need to focus on, well before the test date.    Year 02 - Welcome  Your child has now entered an important stage of their Primary school experience: Key Stage 1 (KS1) and end-of-year attainment tests known as SATs (Scholastic Assessment Tests) which mark the end of their KS1 journey. It is an emotional time for many parents, as their child prepares for their first formal testing and reaches the end of his/her infancy. While you do need to be mindful of the objectives, it is also important to view it as the wonderful year that it is. The final year of KS1 will see your child being encouraged to work more independently. At this age, most children will have improved their ability to coordinate movement and their language/speech will be increasingly complex and grammatically correct, so it’s an exciting year for children, parents, and teachers. This guide will help you to understand what your child will be learning and suggest helpful ways in which you can support them at home.  Year 03 - Increasing independence & empathy     A fun year for your child. The intensity of Year 2 and the focus on grammar, arithmetic, and spelling will seem like a distant memory as the new term starts. This stage marks the end of Key Stage 1, as your child enters Key Stage 2 and becomes a Junior. If they have attended an Infant school, this will also imply a move to a new school, where they become the youngest year group again. Graduation to Junior status comes with new independence and responsibility. Many schools will have rules/traditions which apply only to the older half of their pupils. Sometimes this means a change in uniform, and often an earlier start or later finish to the day. It’s also likely that your child’s break times will change, increasing the time he/she spends in the classroom.   Year 04 -  Time Tables, Confidence & Fun     This is a year in which teachers work to nurture and encourage the feelings of independent thinking, learning and decision making. Pupils already know the routines for Juniors, they are conscious that they need to do homework and are expected to learn a lot during the year. They are usually autonomous in getting dressed. Read on for our guide to life as a parent of a Year 4 pupil.   Year 05 - A Year Of Tranquil Study     This will be a calm and studious year. A year to embed all of the knowledge learned in the previous Key Stage. A year to start the preparations for the transition to secondary school. This is often a year when children mature quite quickly — sometimes even more so than in their final year in Primary. They gain greater independence and confidence from being given more responsibility in their learning. Year 05 pupils are increasingly encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning: to do their homework, to pack their school bag, to remember their PE kits, developing a sense of responsibility and growing as a result. It is about encouraging independence in preparation for bigger things to come.   Year 06 - Memories & Magic     For even the most confident of 10-year-olds (and their parents!), the move to Year 06 can be a daunting time, but it really doesn’t have to be. Being in Year 06 truly is the most memorable time in your child’s Primary education. Year 06 is a key moment in your child’s life; they will develop more independence, a huge amount of resilience and, most importantly, it is a time of self-awareness of who they are, as both learners and young adults.    Year 07 - New Challenges      By the time your child is in Year 06, you’re both pros when it comes to homework schedules, PE kits, friendships and knowing the school building inside and out. The move to a completely new school in Year 07, with new rules, a new layout, dozens of unknown children (and seemingly almost as many teachers) can be unnerving; so, we will talk you through what is expected of both parents and children in the first year of Secondary school. Relationship with the school, and what is expected: The parent/student-teacher/school relationship can feel different in Secondary school. Your child can be taught by up to ten teachers, so you are unlikely to feel you know them as well as their Primary teachers. Your child may find there are some whose style they prefer to others. Try not to be too concerned about this, as it is quite common; Your child will be taught by subject specialists who are passionate about their curriculum areas, so don't be surprised if he/she develops an enthusiasm for certain subjects; Form tutors (and heads of the year) have a pastoral role, although remember they will be subject teachers as well, so these should be your first port of call for general concerns; The school’s website has staff's contact details, and the best way to get in touch is often via e-mail. Subject teachers have full schedules, so may not get a chance to reply until the next day. We recommend contacting the school office if your case is urgent; Parents evenings are usually held once a year at Secondary schools, and consist of meetings with your child's teachers to discuss their performance and related issues, and your child is welcome to come along; It is important for parents to support and enforce the school's code of conduct and dress code, as this leads to a problem-free relationship for everyone.    Year 08 - Start Studying      For many students, it is only the first or second year of Secondary school, so the notion of studying is still somewhat new and unusual. No-one ever really sits you down and tells you exactly how to do it, so often you  can feel quite lost as to how to go about studying effectively, once your first set of big exams come around. I’ve put together a few tips on how to get the process rolling, and how to develop a stable, long-term, study regime, so you are capable of tackling the IGCSE and A Level exams successfully later on. How Best to Start Studying? Start small: - Because you don’t have any major exams coming up just yet, you don’t need to give yourself a big workload or stress yourself out. Try studying lessons on a daily basis. A regular study in the evening after dinner and homework you finish your homework, pick a subject to try and study. Say you pick Irish, try and spend 20-30 minutes studying an irregular verb like “Abair” in the past, present, and future tense. Obviously only study something you’ve covered in class, there’s no point in tackling something new by yourself. Make a plan/timetable: - A study plan or timetable can make it much easier to study, especially before the exams. You can print out a template timetable here. Then fill in each empty box with the times you plan to study (try 20-30 minutes, e.g. 16:00-16:25) and the subjects you’ll study within those times on those days. This makes it easier to commit to studying a certain subject and you’ll save time too because you won’t be fretting about what to study next, it’ll be all laid out in front of you. It’s important to stick to the plan too so that you don’t miss out on studying a certain subject. Highlight/Underline: - This is a great way of helping you remember information. Buy yourself a nice bright highlighter and when you’re studying a certain topic, highlight the words or phrases you think are important. This will make the words jump out at you when you revise them next and you’ll remember them more easily. For example, if you’re studying Science, you would highlight a sentence such as “The normal temperature of an adult human body is 37⁰C”, so that this sentence and this piece of information will stick in your mind, because it’s an important thing to remember. Practice past exam questions: - This is a really important tip because testing yourself lets you see the topics you need to go over as well as to see if your study is paying off. In the 1st and 2nd year, I recommend just looking at the ordinary level questions.   Year 09 - Time of Choices     Year 09 is a pivotal year at school for most young people. Many of them will be growing up through puberty and seeking greater independence from their parents. Within school, it will be the year when they will need to make choices about their education in relation to their further education and employment aspirations. This information has been written to help young people, parents and teachers weigh up the opportunities and choices available at school from Years 09 to 11, thinking about ongoing study, qualifications, and employment whilst balancing the possible restrictions of having only half a working heart. When reading this information it is very important to remember that every young person is different. They will all have abilities, challenges, and aspirations that are different from those of their friends. Every teenager should have an opportunity to reach their full potential. That potential is theirs, not their brothers’ and sisters’ or their peers’. Over their years in school, it is very important that everyone involved in their education looks at them as an individual and sets in place the support, opportunities and care that they need to achieve their very best. Every child should have an opportunity to reach their full potential.   Year 10 - Almost There  The first two years of secondary school offer most pupils the opportunity to study a variety of different subjects. This gives them a chance to explore core subjects like maths, English and sciences and practical subjects, as well as humanities like geography, history, and languages. There will also be subjects like PE, art and design and ICT. Gradually each young person will gain a greater understanding of which subjects they find easy and interesting and which ones are more of a challenge. They will also have begun to understand how to cope with homework and balancing the need to work alongside the fun of childhood. Young adults with only half a working heart have to learn how to use their limited energy to make the most of every day whilst still keeping well.  Year 11 - The End Of The Rainbow     Our Year 11 students have now reached the most vital stage of their academic careers so far and it gives me great pleasure to be their Achievement Team Leader (ATL) to support and guide them on their journey to outstanding results and opportunities. I will look to continue the outstanding work that previous ATL have done I will expect students to continue their focus towards their studies with maturity, high aspirations, and commitment. Year 11 is one of the most exciting, challenging and important times in your child’s education. This year the students will continue in their journey to achieving IGCSE. The high standards of behavior and conduct, expected from all students at The Prime Schools, continue in Year 11. We expect Year 11 pupils to continue to follow the school Code of Conduct and ‘be in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.’ Students’ behavior and attitudes should reflect the importance of this academic year and should include outstanding attendance and punctuality, engagement in lessons, enthusiasm for learning and a keenness to improve. Year 11 students will also require some resilience – lessons will be challenging and will push students to reach their full potential. Students must learn that they will not always master and understand things the first time. They will make mistakes; it’s learning from these mistakes which will help them achieve their full potential. IGCSE pupils will be expected to extend their learning at home, particularly with practice exam questions and papers, and we thank parents for their support and encouragement with this.    Years 12 & 13 - A Small Step...      In the Sixth Form, students are prepared for the Advanced Levels (A Level) examinations. Students also have the opportunity to take an Extended Project Qualification, a self-directed and self-motivated project on a topic of their own choice, which is worth half an A Level. A Levels remain the gold standard for students who aspire to access university in the UK or their home country. A Levels are taken over two years: the first year is called an AS, or Advanced Subsidiary level. This is equal to half an A Level. The second year is called an Advanced level. A Levels are graded A*, A, B, C, D and E. All the courses are taught in English except the language courses, which are taught in the language studied. Competence in English is a prerequisite for success in the A Level programme. It shows that students have the fluency in written and spoken English to meet the demands of an undergraduate university course right from the start. To be eligible to study A Levels, it is highly recommended that students have at least 5 IGCSE passes at grade C or 4 and above (to include Mathematics and English).

The prevalence of project-based learning (PBL) has increased significantly, contributing to serious studies that concluded that PBL promotes lifelong learning skills, authentic knowledge and increases adaptability. A significant relation was found between the PBL method and collaborative learning, disciplinary subject learning, iterative learning, and authentic learning, which, in turn, produced student engagement. The results show that the PBL technique improves student engagement by enabling knowledge and information sharing and discussion. Thus, the PBL approach is highly recommended for educational use by students and should be encouraged in universities.Prime School integrates PBL through the Career ProgrammesBy bringing real-life context and technology to the curriculum through a PBL approach, students are encouraged to become independent workers, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners. Teachers can communicate with administrators, exchange ideas with other teachers and subject-area experts, and communicate with parents, all the while breaking down invisible barriers such as isolation of the classroom, fear of embarking on an unfamiliar process, and lack of assurances of success. PBL is not just a way of learning, it is a way of working together. If students learn to take responsibility for their own learning, they will form the basis for the way they will work with others in their adult lives.Prime school believes that the old-school model of passively acquiring information and reciting them out of context is no longer adequate to prepare kids for today&#39;s society. Thus, Prime School integrates project-based learning (PBL) through the career programmes in parallel with the Cambridge curriculum.Prime School offers a career program to conclude IGCSE and Advanced levels diplomas. Students can choose between Aviation; Aeronautical Engineer, Culinary and Management, Computer and Robotics, Media and Marketing.“Integrating PBL into the school educational project allowed students to gather both foundational learning Students must have both foundational skills (reading, writing, and math) and 21 st century skills, such as teamwork, problem-solving, research gathering, time management, analytical skills, information synthesizing and know-how on high tech tools to solve real-world complex challenges.” -Edite Reina, director officer at Prime School.With this combination of skills, students become directors and managers of their learning process, guided, and mentored by the teachers.“One of the major advantages of project work is that it makes school more like real life. It’s an in-depth investigation of a real-world topic worthy of our attention and effort.”-Alexandre Rüffer    School life & Covid-19 In tune with the status quo of a country plagued by COVID-19, and conscious of its responsibilities  Maria Benedita de Castro Nunes Santos Silva  Read Next          Powered by Odoo  Copyright © Prime School -     Terms of use -     Privacy Policy -     Legal Advice      Powered by Odoo,     the #1 Open Source eCommerce.

PARENTS & CHILDREN  Amanda Costa Santos    Are you concerned or do you feel guilty about not giving your child the amount of attention you feel they deserve?Are you concerned about your child’s adaptation and integration at school?Are you concerned that your child may have serious developmental delays because he/she is a student with special needs?Our Child Support Department is here to help and support you!We understand and acknowledge that it is not easy being a parent these days. The pressure we are under in our fast-paced lives every day forces us to solve every problem that comes our way without necessarily having the tools or resources to do so or being able to plan accordingly. Children are part of our daily life and many times, they do not receive the attention they deserve from us, not because we don't love them but because the pressure of work, family, clients, having to attend to a thousand problems doesn't allow us to be present to the degree we would like to be.Please do not punish yourself, you are doing your best, being a good mother and/or father, no one is expected to be superman or woman. Whilst some days may seem never-ending,  don't be discouraged as your good energy will contaminate everyone around you and your good mood ensure you are rewarded with the affection of your family, friends, and relatives. It is important to remember our motivation and reason for working, why you have children and why you are happy. We suggest connecting with your children on a daily basis, by talking to them individually, without any distractions, ensuring that they really feel listened to and heard. Dedicating 15 minutes to them daily will prove invaluable, more important, in fact, than any gift you can give them.Having listened to them, verbalise your feelings too, this will encourage your children to connect with you and, in turn, build their self-esteem.Ensure you take the time to relax with your children, without a mobile phone or any other distractions and concentrate on building a strong relationship with the ones you love. Adaptability, enabling your child to be more accepting of change.Adaptability is the ability to adapt to new situations and is a very important life-skill. In a rapidly changing world, we live in a state of constant change. It is therefore more important than ever to know how to remain flexible and play the best role as you face these transitions. This will help you cope with life more easily.Adaptability is essential for children as they will go through several stages in a short space of time, requiring them to cope with many factors. It is a skill  which can also help them to better enjoy new experiences, such as moving to a school, moving to another city, taking a holiday in a different place and other life events.While this is good and can be encouraged from an early age, it is also important to respect each child's time and understanding level. Every stimulus should be filled with love for your child, make them feel welcome and develop emotional balance as they look to you for comfort and support: Here are some tips on how to encourage and support children as they adapt to a new scenario in their lives;Being optimistic about change is very important. Help your child to face change with a willingness to face the unknown so that he or she is not afraid or apprehensive. Try to promote constant learningTry to encourage your child to be resilientTry to encourage your child to be empatheticHelp him/her to build self-esteem or seek psychological support with a professional Working together with the school, socio-emotional development is fundamental.Would you like to continue receiving more tips and information on education and family relationships? Subscribe to our newsletter and receive exclusive content directly to your email.Read more Latest Posts    A Brave New Education: Disrupting the Traditional Model through inclusive practices (PBL) Schools towards inclusion and access to quality learning  Maria Benedita de Castro Nunes Santos Silva  Read Next          Powered by Odoo  Copyright © Prime School -     Terms of use -     Privacy Policy -     Legal Advice      Powered by Odoo,     the #1 Open Source eCommerce.

Only available in our Sintra Campus   Our Preschool program is filled with investigation, exploration, and discovery, to accommodate active and enthusiastic children, who seek to refine and expand their skills and knowledge. Thanks to specialized teaching practices, purposefully designed learning environments, and enriched activities, teachers ensure preschoolers have joyful, appropriate, and meaningful learning experiences, that lead to success in academia and professional life. Our preschool program goals and practices aim to fulfill families' expectations of educational excellence, helping young learners grow into confident students.  Preschoolers learn “pre-skills,” which lay the groundwork for the future. Through their playing, singing, and learning, preschoolers gain skills that ultimately help them learn to read, write, build their maths and science skills, and become successful students. Preschoolers also learn “school readiness” skills, which help them understand the routines of school, how to work in a group, and how to be students.     LANGUAGE WORKS     Our preschool programs and curriculum provide pupils with opportunities to integrate listening, speaking, early reading, and writing into daily activities. Preschoolers develop their literacy skills throughout the day, not only during scheduled “reading” time. Teachers use read-aloud as well as poems, songs, and rhymes to teach topics cross-curriculum, and classrooms are filled with signs and labeled objects, which help pupils make connections between objects and words, and words and letters.       MATHS COUNTS     Our preschool teachers create learning experiences that build mathematical skills and reasoning, so pupils can solve problems and use mathematics in real and meaningful ways. Daily preschool maths activities include learning numbers, practicing counting, creating and learning shapes, and working with calendars. In addition, playing with puzzles, building toys, blocks, and games help preschoolers practice and build maths skills as they count, manipulate objects, and work with different shapes and sizes.     ART SMART  Our preschool teachers nurture pupils' intrinsic artistic abilities and help them appreciate art in the broader world, by engaging them in varied creative activities.   SCIENCE ROCKS Throughout our preschool science curriculum, teachers carefully plan experiments that not only develop scientific skills but also nurture pupils' natural curiosity. The class will learn about a certain topic (for e.g.: water, weather, animals, plants, and nature) through the use of books, demonstrations with actual objects, exploration outdoors, or interactive activities. In addition, preschoolers are natural scientists as they play and explore the world around them with their inquisitive minds. They constantly experiment and learn as they play outside, explore natural objects, and play with toys such as clay, sandboxes, and water tables.          Note:Estoril Campus: Whole curriculum taught in EnglishSintra Campus: Bilingual curriculum (Portuguese and English)    Creative Ways of Teaching   SCIENCES  Investigating objects in a light box or in a light table; Predicting daily weather; Using microscopes and documenting observations through pictures and charts.

In these years of knowledge, our educators prioritize the learning and development of values ​​that allow young students to grow in a consolidated way, forming innovative and creative young people, with a general and individual conscience that allows them to be respected and respect others as well as the environment around them.  This phase translates into a hectic, exciting phase in which children develop and deepen what they learned in their first discoveries at school. This stage is dedicated to hands-on, where knowing how to do, knowing how to create, knowing how to produce, knowing how to contemplate, and knowing how to internalize what we build with care every day, allows us to grow in a sustained and happy way.  The objectives and practices of our primary education program have been defined over the last 20 years, due to the educational and pedagogical excellence, and above all, the affectionate friendship and commitment that the entire educational community involved in the learning of each student has always offered in a special way for everyone.   We offer children supportive learning environments and dynamic educational experiences that enable them to achieve academic success, gain knowledge in key subject areas, and develop personal responsibility and integrity. Our students learn skills that lay the foundation for the future.

At this stage, from 11 to 15 years old, students enter a new phase of learning, our aim is to maintain adult influence while we emphasize interdisciplinarity and provide a global and view of current events. In our famous secondary I and II, students develop projects with a focus on research, development and investigation.  Our Secondary school teachers believe in the potential of each and every student. They differentiate instruction by using learning, assessment, and communication tools to discover each student's strengths, weaknesses and work collaboratively with families to establish individual academic goals and learning plans.  In Secondary 1 we continue the work developed in the primary school, where ""Hands-on'' is fundamental, where planning a project, creating a work team, exchanging knowledge and ideas, and achieving it is our primary objective.    In Secondary 2 students, we incentivize students to become more autonomous and independent, by working on innovation, technology and creativity in various fields such as robotics, joinery, weaving, electronics, which contribute to the improvement of their mathematical, linguistic, physical and environmental techniques, with teachers alongside them, facilitating, guiding and showing them that learning can be both demanding and exciting.

What do they want to do for the rest of their lives?  Amanda Costa Santos   This decision does not come easy.Some follow in the paths of their parents, while others pursue a passion they have had since they were kids. However, for most, once school ends, they are lost as to what to do next. I, myself, want to become a pilot, however, my dream has always been to get a degree. I have always liked business and interacting with people so a degree in business management seemed rather fitting to me, although I already decided this some years ago. How do you know what subjects to choose? Which university to go to, if one at all? Prime School provides a unique method for solving this problem. They provide practical classes which aim to help students explore their passions and witness a small part of what it is like to pursue a particular career. For example, their Aviation Career Program strives to demonstrate to students what it is like to be a pilot; the kinds of knowledge and skills they would need as well as actual flying lessons on their full-motion simulator. Students learn more of what life is like in a particular career field rather than actually learning the material of said career. In IT and Robotics career classes, you will invent, innovate and problem-solve.In marketing, you will discover a new way of selling and analyzing products and businesses. These are just a few career classes to name. Prime School’s aim is to help students achieve their full potential and provide them with the best start to their career life. Life can be daunting, especially when you are deciding on your future, however having support and guidance regarding your future can provide a world of peace.      How can parents become more involved in their children's education? Do you monitor your child's school performance? Understand the role of parents in their children's education.

How can parents become more involved in their children's education? Do you monitor your child's school performance? Understand the role of parents in their children's education.  Amanda Costa Santos    Learn how to help your child learn effectively at homeAnyone with children knows that their study time exceeds the time they spend in school. Having time to do homework, prepare speeches and assignments. In these situations, it is very important that children and teenagers can count on the company of their parents, but many people still do not know how to help their children to learn.Many people think that it is enough to let their children do their homework and then ask them if they do it, but in most cases, this is not enough. Whether it's a distraction, lack of engagement, lack of understanding, or any cognitive problem, we need to be more attentive to this issue. Closer monitoring - especially for young children - is needed to encourage and foster effective learning and learning.Many factors affect children's learning. Therefore, we have prepared some tips on what parents can do to promote an effective experience for their children during their studies. Follow-up!How can you help children to learn?You can take different actions and interventions to help. They range from modifying the learning space to more active attention to school activities. You should consider that each case is unique and the age of the child is an important factor in determining how to act.Below are some guidelines to help you start this journey with your child:Create a suitable learning environmentIt is very important that your child has sufficient learning space without being disturbed by the environment. In this regard, pay attention to whether the space he uses for activities has the following features:good lightinggood ventilationspace for books and notebooksfurniture of an appropriate sizea comfortable chair that helps maintain good posturesilence and privacy (especially for older people).In addition, working with him keeps the place organised and the materials he needs are still at hand. You can encourage him to organise and decorate the space himself, making it a pleasant environment that he enjoys.Make a study planTo develop study habits, regularity is essential. Therefore, learning becomes a daily activity and does not need to be postponed or avoided until all the work and tasks pile up and become a burden.To that end, according to your child's daily activities, performance and the average amount of activity, work with your child to determine daily study time or study time - there is always a gap. At this point, it is important to consider the age of the child/teenager, knowing that younger children may stay focused for a shorter period of time than older ones.Also, be careful not to overload. It is important to have time off and rest every day, this does not necessarily interfere or prevent your child from focusing on learning. Talk to your child and develop a routine that includes all this time and is relevant to both of you.Ask your child what he has learnedEncourage your child to talk about what they are learning as this will help them better understand and memorise what they are studying. Instead of asking him to remember or giving automatic answers, ask thought-provoking questions, such as ""Why is that?"" And ""What do you think?"" If you master the topic, you can help him accordingly.In addition to these behaviors, also avoid answering for him. Even if he has knowledge of the content, ask him to examine books and notebooks to find what he needs - using the Internet as a last resort. If he can't find the answer and doesn't know either, encourage him to ask the class teacher the next day. If necessary, help them compose the question, so they still create more of a connection.Use technological resources to your advantageMany times the internet can be harmful to learning, due to distractions, but at other times it can be a great ally. We must know how to pass this concept to the child. There are several applications that provide tools to assist in their studies, in addition to numerous free search engines available.You can take the opportunity to talk to your child about the appropriate use of the Internet and the importance of searching for reliable sources. Especially if he is younger, try to first browse the internet with him and show him how to do a search, which sites and pages he should use and how he can verify the information found.If he is older, he may have more autonomy to use the internet on his own. However, make sure that, during study time, he is not distracted on other sites, or on social networks. This is common, and even we do it ourselves from time to time, but it can hinder concentration and the quality of the study.Be presentAs you may have realised by now, your presence is the most important factor in the whole process. The younger your child is, the more availability you need to have to accompany him/her on the learning path. Don't forget that it is important to show that you care about your child's learning and that you are there to answer questions and help whenever necessary.In addition, always try to promote a humanised education. Do not forget to praise the work well done and correct whatever you think is necessary, always in a kind way and without making unnecessary criticisms or scolding. This will make your child trust you and not hesitate to seek guidance when he/she needs it.Little by little and with time, as the activities adapt to your routine, things will get easier and they will create more autonomy, searching for their own way of studying. However, be sure to always follow up and supervise, even if more distant, and check what is being done.Finally, do not forget to educate by example. Hardly, parents who do not care about school and learning, or who do not give importance to education, will have children committed and interested in studying.We know that the education of children and adolescents is only possible when there is family participation. That is why it is so important that parents are available and participate in the formation of autonomous and intelligent adults.Now that you know how to help your child to study efficiently, follow us on social networks and get access to more content like this! Learn more     What is the importance of international education, and who benefits from it?

They appreciate that the demand for our curriculum and the rigor of our assessments equip students with the tools necessary to flourish in Higher Education.    Preschool -   Start Of A New Life  This stage is about far more than colors and shapes, numbers and letters. This is the stage in which your child lays the foundations for academia, developing his/her independence, confidence, resilience and curiosity. It’s an exciting time for children and parents alike, as school life takes off. As parents, we can feel anxious about our child starting ‘big school’ – will they adapt to a bigger class and larger premises? Will they make friends easily? But children are flexible and very soon adjust to their exciting new environment.  Year 01 -   Light-Touch Learning & Plenty Of Fun!  Leaving Preschool behind and moving onto Year 01, can feel like a major step for a children and his parents. Your child’s Homeroom teacher is there to facilitate this transition, by supporting pupils and their parents. Year 01 teachers comment on how pupils return from their summer break appearing more grown up, wiser and ready for a challenge. In this phase, pupils are still learning through playing, exploring, discovering, and enjoying role-playing. Your child’s day will be a little more structured than it was in Preschool, and he/she may have to sit at a table for a little longer than they are used to, but they will be learning in a variety of ways - while moving, exploring the outdoors, in groups, on the carpet, or walking around the school!  What Will My Child Do In Year 01?  This is the first year of the Cambridge Curriculum. Like all year groups, Year 01 has government statutory schemes of learning to comply with. All children are supported in their development and are given extra support and guidance if needed. There is a Year 01 phonics screening test in June, which helps your child’s Homeroom teacher to identify if he/she is secure in pronouncing and blending graphemes. It also detects if they can read phonically decodable words. Don’t be concerned about formal evaluation: the Homeroom teacher will assess your child daily and will have identified any areas they need to focus on, well before the test date.    Year 02 - Welcome  Your child has now entered an important stage of their Primary school experience: Key Stage 1 (KS1) and end-of-year attainment tests known as SATs (Scholastic Assessment Tests) which mark the end of their KS1 journey. It is an emotional time for many parents, as their child prepares for their first formal testing and reaches the end of his/her infancy. While you do need to be mindful of the objectives, it is also important to view it as the wonderful year that it is. The final year of KS1 will see your child being encouraged to work more independently. At this age, most children will have improved their ability to coordinate movement and their language/speech will be increasingly complex and grammatically correct, so it’s an exciting year for children, parents, and teachers. This guide will help you to understand what your child will be learning and suggest helpful ways in which you can support them at home.  Year 03 - Increasing independence & empathy     A fun year for your child. The intensity of Year 2 and the focus on grammar, arithmetic, and spelling will seem like a distant memory as the new term starts. This stage marks the end of Key Stage 1, as your child enters Key Stage 2 and becomes a Junior. If they have attended an Infant school, this will also imply a move to a new school, where they become the youngest year group again. Graduation to Junior status comes with new independence and responsibility. Many schools will have rules/traditions which apply only to the older half of their pupils. Sometimes this means a change in uniform, and often an earlier start or later finish to the day. It’s also likely that your child’s break times will change, increasing the time he/she spends in the classroom.   Year 04 -  Time Tables, Confidence & Fun     This is a year in which teachers work to nurture and encourage the feelings of independent thinking, learning and decision making. Pupils already know the routines for Juniors, they are conscious that they need to do homework and are expected to learn a lot during the year. They are usually autonomous in getting dressed. Read on for our guide to life as a parent of a Year 4 pupil.   Year 05 - A Year Of Tranquil Study     This will be a calm and studious year. A year to embed all of the knowledge learned in the previous Key Stage. A year to start the preparations for the transition to secondary school. This is often a year when children mature quite quickly — sometimes even more so than in their final year in Primary. They gain greater independence and confidence from being given more responsibility in their learning. Year 05 pupils are increasingly encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning: to do their homework, to pack their school bag, to remember their PE kits, developing a sense of responsibility and growing as a result. It is about encouraging independence in preparation for bigger things to come.   Year 06 - Memories & Magic     For even the most confident of 10-year-olds (and their parents!), the move to Year 06 can be a daunting time, but it really doesn’t have to be. Being in Year 06 truly is the most memorable time in your child’s Primary education. Year 06 is a key moment in your child’s life; they will develop more independence, a huge amount of resilience and, most importantly, it is a time of self-awareness of who they are, as both learners and young adults.    Year 07 - New Challenges      By the time your child is in Year 06, you’re both pros when it comes to homework schedules, PE kits, friendships and knowing the school building inside and out. The move to a completely new school in Year 07, with new rules, a new layout, dozens of unknown children (and seemingly almost as many teachers) can be unnerving; so, we will talk you through what is expected of both parents and children in the first year of Secondary school. Relationship with the school, and what is expected: The parent/student-teacher/school relationship can feel different in Secondary school. Your child can be taught by up to ten teachers, so you are unlikely to feel you know them as well as their Primary teachers. Your child may find there are some whose style they prefer to others. Try not to be too concerned about this, as it is quite common; Your child will be taught by subject specialists who are passionate about their curriculum areas, so don't be surprised if he/she develops an enthusiasm for certain subjects; Form tutors (and heads of the year) have a pastoral role, although remember they will be subject teachers as well, so these should be your first port of call for general concerns; The school’s website has staff's contact details, and the best way to get in touch is often via e-mail. Subject teachers have full schedules, so may not get a chance to reply until the next day. We recommend contacting the school office if your case is urgent; Parents evenings are usually held once a year at Secondary schools, and consist of meetings with your child's teachers to discuss their performance and related issues, and your child is welcome to come along; It is important for parents to support and enforce the school's code of conduct and dress code, as this leads to a problem-free relationship for everyone.    Year 08 - Start Studying      For many students, it is only the first or second year of Secondary school, so the notion of studying is still somewhat new and unusual. No-one ever really sits you down and tells you exactly how to do it, so often you  can feel quite lost as to how to go about studying effectively, once your first set of big exams come around. I’ve put together a few tips on how to get the process rolling, and how to develop a stable, long-term, study regime, so you are capable of tackling the IGCSE and A Level exams successfully later on. How Best to Start Studying? Start small: - Because you don’t have any major exams coming up just yet, you don’t need to give yourself a big workload or stress yourself out. Try studying lessons on a daily basis. A regular study in the evening after dinner and homework you finish your homework, pick a subject to try and study. Say you pick Irish, try and spend 20-30 minutes studying an irregular verb like “Abair” in the past, present, and future tense. Obviously only study something you’ve covered in class, there’s no point in tackling something new by yourself. Make a plan/timetable: - A study plan or timetable can make it much easier to study, especially before the exams. You can print out a template timetable here. Then fill in each empty box with the times you plan to study (try 20-30 minutes, e.g. 16:00-16:25) and the subjects you’ll study within those times on those days. This makes it easier to commit to studying a certain subject and you’ll save time too because you won’t be fretting about what to study next, it’ll be all laid out in front of you. It’s important to stick to the plan too so that you don’t miss out on studying a certain subject. Highlight/Underline: - This is a great way of helping you remember information. Buy yourself a nice bright highlighter and when you’re studying a certain topic, highlight the words or phrases you think are important. This will make the words jump out at you when you revise them next and you’ll remember them more easily. For example, if you’re studying Science, you would highlight a sentence such as “The normal temperature of an adult human body is 37⁰C”, so that this sentence and this piece of information will stick in your mind, because it’s an important thing to remember. Practice past exam questions: - This is a really important tip because testing yourself lets you see the topics you need to go over as well as to see if your study is paying off. In the 1st and 2nd year, I recommend just looking at the ordinary level questions.   Year 09 - Time of Choices     Year 09 is a pivotal year at school for most young people. Many of them will be growing up through puberty and seeking greater independence from their parents. Within school, it will be the year when they will need to make choices about their education in relation to their further education and employment aspirations. This information has been written to help young people, parents and teachers weigh up the opportunities and choices available at school from Years 09 to 11, thinking about ongoing study, qualifications, and employment whilst balancing the possible restrictions of having only half a working heart. When reading this information it is very important to remember that every young person is different. They will all have abilities, challenges, and aspirations that are different from those of their friends. Every teenager should have an opportunity to reach their full potential. That potential is theirs, not their brothers’ and sisters’ or their peers’. Over their years in school, it is very important that everyone involved in their education looks at them as an individual and sets in place the support, opportunities and care that they need to achieve their very best. Every child should have an opportunity to reach their full potential.   Year 10 - Almost There  The first two years of secondary school offer most pupils the opportunity to study a variety of different subjects. This gives them a chance to explore core subjects like maths, English and sciences and practical subjects, as well as humanities like geography, history, and languages. There will also be subjects like PE, art and design and ICT. Gradually each young person will gain a greater understanding of which subjects they find easy and interesting and which ones are more of a challenge. They will also have begun to understand how to cope with homework and balancing the need to work alongside the fun of childhood. Young adults with only half a working heart have to learn how to use their limited energy to make the most of every day whilst still keeping well.  Year 11 - The End Of The Rainbow     Our Year 11 students have now reached the most vital stage of their academic careers so far and it gives me great pleasure to be their Achievement Team Leader (ATL) to support and guide them on their journey to outstanding results and opportunities. I will look to continue the outstanding work that previous ATL have done I will expect students to continue their focus towards their studies with maturity, high aspirations, and commitment. Year 11 is one of the most exciting, challenging and important times in your child’s education. This year the students will continue in their journey to achieving IGCSE. The high standards of behavior and conduct, expected from all students at The Prime Schools, continue in Year 11. We expect Year 11 pupils to continue to follow the school Code of Conduct and ‘be in the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing.’ Students’ behavior and attitudes should reflect the importance of this academic year and should include outstanding attendance and punctuality, engagement in lessons, enthusiasm for learning and a keenness to improve. Year 11 students will also require some resilience – lessons will be challenging and will push students to reach their full potential. Students must learn that they will not always master and understand things the first time. They will make mistakes; it’s learning from these mistakes which will help them achieve their full potential. IGCSE pupils will be expected to extend their learning at home, particularly with practice exam questions and papers, and we thank parents for their support and encouragement with this.    Years 12 & 13 - A Small Step...      In the Sixth Form, students are prepared for the Advanced Levels (A Level) examinations. Students also have the opportunity to take an Extended Project Qualification, a self-directed and self-motivated project on a topic of their own choice, which is worth half an A Level. A Levels remain the gold standard for students who aspire to access university in the UK or their home country. A Levels are taken over two years: the first year is called an AS, or Advanced Subsidiary level. This is equal to half an A Level. The second year is called an Advanced level. A Levels are graded A*, A, B, C, D and E. All the courses are taught in English except the language courses, which are taught in the language studied. Competence in English is a prerequisite for success in the A Level programme. It shows that students have the fluency in written and spoken English to meet the demands of an undergraduate university course right from the start. To be eligible to study A Levels, it is highly recommended that students have at least 5 IGCSE passes at grade C or 4 and above (to include Mathematics and English).

Students perform best scores in PISA, and teachers report the importance of systemic reform to the traditional schooling approach.: ""Finland exemplifies the principle of slow schooling described by Honoré (2004) as leading patiently to sustainable success (also Hargreaves and Fink, 2006), compared to the rush to raise test scores quickly."" (OECD,2007) Finland, like all Nordic countries, values lifelong learning and therefore has no standardized or high stakes testing method and therefore does not devote resources and time to test production and preparation (Sahlberg, 2006). Instead, it has a broad curriculum that is not preoccupied with tested basics. Maths and sciences are essential for business and economic development, but so are artistic and other forms of creativity that have long contributed to the Finnish school identity. As a result, Finland promotes quality learning and records the lowest high dropout rates. Finland committed to reforming the traditional system by improving and developing the curricular steering system, achieved through shared values, high participation, and widespread cooperation via curricular reform. Furthermore, Finland has demonstrated a solid commitment to inclusive, equal, and innovative social ideals both outside and within the educational system. Therefore, the prevention of dropout rates and promoting quality learning passes through restructuring the school pedagogically to promote school success.Prime school, instead of following the industrial traditional model, where classrooms resemble a fabric, the school believes that there is always space for improvement.Dropping out of school and early schooling leaving were seen as a certain inevitability dependent, above all, on the children's inability to learn, on the young people's lack of interest in Education, or on the (non) willingness of families to keep their children in school, therefore it was considered as a phenomenon that did not depend on school organization, pedagogical methods, teacher qualifications or national and local policies brought to the field by the management of schools. Nevertheless, through various studies and throughout the years the consensus, is becoming more evident that the pedagogical practices are key to avoiding dropout rates and ensuring an inclusive approach. For example, in a study conducted by Mohlouoa (2014), the dropout rates were not strongly linked with social and economic conditions; instead, the pedagogical approach played a major role.Since Prime School believes that every child has the right to a second opportunity, the school follows a non-retention policy, where all students are incentivized to reach their full potential. Therefore, Prime school opts for a different pedagogical approach where practices intend to put the student in the center, customizing the curriculum to fit the best needs of each and every student. The pedagogical board in Prime school is composed of a group of educational researchers to guarantee and ensure that education is delivered in the best quality possible.The democratization of Education leads eventually to the massification of Education. Massification of Education is supported by the assumption that only the one-size-fits-all approach would guarantee equality for all. The problem is not that we must have a school for all. Instead, it is the wrong idea that school should be the same for all, since students are heterogeneous, and they don’t learn in the same way. Finland, for example, as the role model of Education, refused to engage in the principle of Massification. Massification as the ""equality temptation"" represents one of the major causes of school failure and early school leaving. (Silva & Pinto, 2016). The aim is to prevent students from disconnecting from school, promote school success, and ensure the quality of learning. Prime school delivers a student-centered approach in order to combat the one-size-fits-all as a means of learning.In Portugal the educational model is centralized, therefore public schools cannot manage the curriculum. While in Prime School, an International private school follows the Cambridge curriculum and it possesses a certain degree of autonomy to adapt the curriculum according to the student's capacities and desires. For the reasons presented above, the Pedagogical Director of Prime School, Edite Reina, makes quality education and inclusion a priority for 21st-century students, in accordance with the UN SDGs 2030.The school of the 21st century questions its place as a space for the construction of knowledge. The reflection on the demands and urgencies of compulsory schooling of twelve years in a liquid world, in constant change, announces a paradigm transformation about school success. Teaching in the middle of the digital age contributes to creating ""never-before-seen opportunities to make teaching a passionate and motivating profession that makes a difference for a future society. Such opportunities are related to new roles, new content and new teaching and learning methods"".  From the most recently produced reflections, new goals were announced, skills to be acquired by students - the 4 C's (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity) gave way to 6 C's - critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, citizenship, personality (Fullan & Geoff Scott, 2014).In 2009, the European Council established a strategic framework for European cooperation in the field of Education and training, agreeing, by 2020:Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality. Improve the quality and effectiveness of Education and training.Promote equality, social cohesion, and active citizenship. Encourage creativity and innovation, including the entrepreneurial spirit, at all levels of Education and training.The document stresses that lifelong learning should be considered a fundamental principle. It should include learning in all contexts (formal, non-formal, and informal) and at all levels: from pre-school and school Education to higher Education, vocational education and training, and adult education. Prime school offers vocational training if the students are committed to taking a step forward. In the last decade, worldwide educational innovation has driven new practices that impact and improve students' motivation and learning. Examples are Finland and the network of Jesuit schools in Barcelona. Prime school follows such examples and disrupts the traditional classroom model where the teacher debits and the students reproduce, with the PBL approach students have the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge acquired in the classroom and apply it to real-life situations closer to what will be faced when entering the labor market.The importance of pre-school and teacher training is highlighted, one of the main actors of change. In Prime School, a change that integrates new ways of organizing class groups, schedules, and disciplines and spaces, which have been adapted to new organizational forms is in place. The teacher-student ratio corresponds to 1-5. ""They conceive school activities in larger groups, from 2 to 3 basic classes, with the respective teachers teaching at the same time, sometimes working with all students, sometimes breaking down into different groups, with variable geometry, according to the type of activity in progress the pace of learning and carrying out activities, and also according to the projects in execution"". -Amanda Santos, Marketing TeacherPrime school takes a student-centered approach:In short, it is at school that qualitative and sustainable change may or may not happen, regardless of what is enacted. And it is at the level of the classroom or the (which can be multiple) and what teachers do with student teaching-learning moments that change can occur, if teachers duly supported, duly clarified and able to inform, feeling part of a professional culture that reflected, dialogue and discussed common goals of according to the diversity of students it has, and which concluded the need for change in structure. “A school change is multidimensional, involving the purpose, the structure, the culture, politics, continuous learning, and discreet administration (...) everything affects everything else '' (Hargreaves, Earl, and Ryan, 1996). If education plays a major role in social change, it will be no less true that social changes call for a rethinking of education. But, unfortunately, the successive reforms applied had little influence on teaching practices. Therefore, having seen the failure of some supposed innovations in the organization of teaching, evidenced in the continuation of retentions, school dropout, demotivation of students and teachers, it is urgent to think again and in continuity, the importance of the “School” and its practices.Prime school wants to revolutionize the education system in place and it's reflected on the results of students. The majority of Prime school students have access to the world's best universitiesFurthermore, if the examples from schools that dared to change the current models resulted in the promotion of school success, it is advisable to think about the changes necessary for success to occur in our educational contexts.Curriculum as the GamechangerPrime school believes that Portugal needs a school where pedagogical stagnation does not recur and where better results are obtained. ""The curriculum and the way it is managed can be decisive in this process”, referring to the process of improving the schooling system in Portugal.“In our school where innovation takes place, (…) in a logic of continuous professional development, and assuming shared and collective responsibility for the learning process of all students) Teachers assume themselves as builders and not mere executors of the curriculum, a sine qua non condition for implementing pedagogical innovations leading to relevant improvements in their students' learning."" -Gabrielle Parrinha, Pedagogical SecretariatCurriculum reform became in the past decade the primary focus for Education reform in Europe. The European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop)   released a study in 2012 named ""Curriculum reform in Europe and the impact of learning outcomes”. It concluded that curricula reform can benefit both the teachers and students and that making changes to the curriculum resulted in more effective and meaningful learning and teaching. The literature surrounding curriculum development and innovation suggests that dissemination (curriculum) occupies a central role in the process of change. (Fullan, 2008)""In the face of an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, education can make the difference as to whether people embrace the challenges they are confronted with or whether they defeat them. And in an era characterized by a new explosion of scientific knowledge and a growing array of complex societal problems, it is appropriate that curricula should continue to evolve, perhaps in radical ways."" (OECD,2018)Materializing the changeInclusive education and curricular reform are key towards the aim to promote school success, which Prime School aims to achieve. Several studies have been carried out in order to grasp the effectiveness of promoting school inclusion through curricular reform. Inclusion demands curricular flexibility since not all students learn the same way. The “one-size-fits-all” approach becomes obsolete and contributes to school dropout rates and early school abandonment. (Rafo & Gunter, 2008)The commitment to inclusive education, as described in ""Policy guidance on inclusion in education"" by UNESCO (2009) it’s a process aimed at responding to the diversity of pupils' needs by expanding the involvement and participation of all in learning and the life of the school community, was reaffirmed by Portugal's adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol, which was adopted at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on December 13, 2006.  In Portugal, it was approved by Assembly Resolution 56/2009 on July 30, ratified by Presidential Decree 71/2009, and reaffirmed in the ""Lisbon Declaration on Educational Equity"" in July 2015. This pledge also aims to achieve the UN Agenda 2030's sustainable development goals. Portugal, therefore, elaborated the document “Students Profile for the 21st century”, a guiding matrix of current decisions regarding the educational process: Framed in the recommendations of the European Union, in the international documents of the OECD Education Project 2030,  and Education 2030 Framework for Action, by UNESCO, which Prime School International pays close attention to, in order to implement it in the school's policy. The Portuguese Ministry of Education established a student profile after leaving compulsory education defining a frame of reference that presupposes their freedom, responsibility, appreciation of work, self-awareness, family and community insertion, and participation in a rapidly changing society. The document explains principles, vision, values, competencies, and learnings. Some principles that underlie curricular work are listed:Establishing a humanistic base profile, understanding knowledge as fundamental to the construction of a society centered on human beings and their dignity.Contribute to sustainable development; put reality at the center of learning through flexible curriculum management; develop adaptability and boldness.Guarantee stability so that the system adapts. The reformulations take effect, placing the school at the center of the valorization of knowledge through the awakening and promotion of intellectual curiosity.How does Prime school put it into practice?Prime School makes the Student Profile for the 21st Century, a priority:Address each area of ​​knowledge's contents to situations and problems present in the student's daily life or present in the socio-cultural and geographical environment in which it operates, using materials and diversified resources. Organize teaching by providing experimentation with techniques, diversified instruments, and forms of work, promoting intentionally, in the classroom or outside, observation activities, questioning reality and integrating knowledge. Organize and develop cooperative learning activities oriented towards the integration and exchange of knowledge, awareness raising themselves, others and the environment, and realizing projects out of school. Organize teaching by providing critical use of information sources and information and communication technologies. Promote systematically and intentionally, in the classroom and outside, activities that allow students to make choices, confront points of view, solve problems, and make decisions based on values.Create spaces and times at school for students to intervene freely and responsibly. To value, in the evaluation of the student's learning, the work of the free initiative, encouraging positive intervention in the school environment and community (DGES, 2017)The role of the TeacherThis section starts to present the Teacher’s importance and the necessary commitment to comply with the expectations of the Prime school and implement them. The teacher is the primary agent for curriculum reform since the teachers and school leaders are responsible for designing it. Therefore, this section will analyze the teaching profession and its impacts on curriculum design and implementation.The methodology for infallible student success continues to be discussed over the years, and no conclusion yet has been reached. However, a consensus that ""The traditional forms of teaching are now obsolete” (Cardoso, 2013) starts to be pointed out. The methodology that accompanied the school fixed in the classrooms for several years should be reconsidered since it marginalized those who could not learn (Robinson & Aronica, 2010). Prime school takes the opportunity to reform the traditional model's classroom layout, considered archaic, although it is still timeless in many classrooms.There is a vast range of strategies to achieve student success, enforce programs, acquire skills and values, and teach according to the profiles in a didactic, active and individualized way. However, there is no methodology or strategy for school success capable of covering all student profiles since its application/implementation determines that the actor-teachers balance and act rationally in each particular context. The teacher's work goes beyond the classroom and the act of teaching and correcting tests. Portugal and other European countries have currently changed teaching methodologies at the school, attempting to promote students' success. The teacher must remember that they represent “a model of conduct and civics for students"", and therefore, the more culture he demonstrates, the more captive and more competent they will be, thus giving the teacher ""an added responsibility”. In short, ""when students appreciate a teacher and trust him, they like to know her/his opinion on issues that go beyond the strict classroom materials"" (Cardoso, 2013).In Prime school, the teacher does not only guide, accompany, and motivate the student, but teachers should also be responsible for developing students’ skills “such as cooperation, research and the ability to debate,” as defended by Cohen & Fradique (2018). Therefore, teachers create the curriculum in co-authorship with other teachers, focusing on the students' cognitive characteristics. Throughout the process, they should do the ""setting of objectives, selection, and integration of contents; design of teaching strategies, operationalization of activities, streamlining and organization of resources and teaching materials; guidance and monitoring of students and appropriation of evaluation criteria” (Cohen & Fradique, 2018). Lifelong learning and the autonomy to do so is one of the objectives of implementing the student's profile after leaving mandatory schooling principles: ""education must intentionally promote the development of the ability to learn, the basis of lifelong learning"" (Martins et al., 2017). Therefore, in addition to adequate the changes and adaptations that the teacher must have throughout his professional career, according to Martins et al. (2017), the teacher must also perform some actions that linked with the areas of competence of the profile of the student, such as: promoting activities that allow students to master and express the various forms of expression and communication associated with ""language, literature, music, arts, technologies, mathematics and science"".In Prime School, the professors build the annual plan at the end of the school year (July). The class professors accompany them from the previous year, and the teachers of each course are allocated, purposely, for the project sessions. In this meeting, they define, through the agglutinating theme, the sub-themes, and subjects they intend to work on. Throughout the year, once a week, the teachers are supposed to meet to discuss the next week and use an informal group on social networks to stay in touch or finalize some details after school time, stipulated for planning.Implementing Curricular ChangesAutonomy and curriculum flexibility is helpful to schools seeking to create collaborative planning time for teachers. At the same time, however, these efforts invite technical complexities (e.g., structure school time, arranging interdisciplinary learning when designing curriculum flexibility…)To implement curricular changes, teachers must develop foundational professional practices that help them achieve new curricular and pedagogical goals. By defining, developing, and enacting these new practices over time, teachers can continually improve their practices. Some of the foundational Portuguese’s methods that teachers could benefit from cultivating and sustaining include:Prioritizing student learning and engagement Developing a culture of learning, trust, creativity and thoughtful risk-taking (Guin, 2004)regularly practising faculty collaboration, student collaboration, reflection and action to improve teaching practices, and engaging and building partnerships with community members and other stakeholders (Darling-Hammond & Richardson, 2009).These practices are vital and they are central for Prime School. Cultivating foundational professional practices that enable teachers and students to exercise autonomy and flexibility takes time. For example, interdisciplinary learning requires teachers in different subject areas to collaborate and learn from each other to find content areas that are amenable to merging. It requires students and teachers to learn and reflect and iterate their practices (Harris & Jones, 2020). Thus, new pedagogical and curricular practices take time to develop and implement, which started 20 years ago when the school was created.ConclusionPrime school: Core activities and benefitsIntensive Music and Arts  Vocational training and accompaniment through the Career ProgrammesCambridge CurriculumOur multicultural school engages in inclusion and the benefits of a bilingual education Wide scope of teaching and learningTeachers are mentors and not figures of authorityStrong pedagogical and educational researchersopenness to foster the development of the best education for the studentMix approach between Project-based learning approach and a Student-centered approachTeacher-student ratio: 1-7 studentsextracurricular activities programmeICT enthusiast   An innovative approach for the students Project-Based Learning  Alexandre Rüffer  Read Next          Powered by Odoo  Copyright © Prime School -     Terms of use -     Privacy Policy -     Legal Advice      Powered by Odoo,     the #1 Open Source eCommerce.

Students perform best scores in PISA, and teachers report the importance of systemic reform to the traditional schooling approach.: ""Finland exemplifies the principle of slow schooling described by Honoré (2004) as leading patiently to sustainable success (also Hargreaves and Fink, 2006), compared to the rush to raise test scores quickly."" (OECD,2007) Finland, like all Nordic countries, values lifelong learning and therefore has no standardized or high stakes testing method and therefore does not devote resources and time to test production and preparation (Sahlberg, 2006). Instead, it has a broad curriculum that is not preoccupied with tested basics. Maths and sciences are essential for business and economic development, but so are artistic and other forms of creativity that have long contributed to the Finnish school identity. As a result, Finland promotes quality learning and records the lowest high dropout rates. Finland committed to reforming the traditional system by improving and developing the curricular steering system, achieved through shared values, high participation, and widespread cooperation via curricular reform. Furthermore, Finland has demonstrated a solid commitment to inclusive, equal, and innovative social ideals both outside and within the educational system. Therefore, the prevention of dropout rates and promoting quality learning passes through restructuring the school pedagogically to promote school success.Prime school, instead of following the industrial traditional model, where classrooms resemble a fabric, the school believes that there is always space for improvement.Dropping out of school and early schooling leaving were seen as a certain inevitability dependent, above all, on the children's inability to learn, on the young people's lack of interest in Education, or on the (non) willingness of families to keep their children in school, therefore it was considered as a phenomenon that did not depend on school organization, pedagogical methods, teacher qualifications or national and local policies brought to the field by the management of schools. Nevertheless, through various studies and throughout the years the consensus, is becoming more evident that the pedagogical practices are key to avoiding dropout rates and ensuring an inclusive approach. For example, in a study conducted by Mohlouoa (2014), the dropout rates were not strongly linked with social and economic conditions; instead, the pedagogical approach played a major role.Since Prime School believes that every child has the right to a second opportunity, the school follows a non-retention policy, where all students are incentivized to reach their full potential. Therefore, Prime school opts for a different pedagogical approach where practices intend to put the student in the center, customizing the curriculum to fit the best needs of each and every student. The pedagogical board in Prime school is composed of a group of educational researchers to guarantee and ensure that education is delivered in the best quality possible.The democratization of Education leads eventually to the massification of Education. Massification of Education is supported by the assumption that only the one-size-fits-all approach would guarantee equality for all. The problem is not that we must have a school for all. Instead, it is the wrong idea that school should be the same for all, since students are heterogeneous, and they don’t learn in the same way. Finland, for example, as the role model of Education, refused to engage in the principle of Massification. Massification as the ""equality temptation"" represents one of the major causes of school failure and early school leaving. (Silva & Pinto, 2016). The aim is to prevent students from disconnecting from school, promote school success, and ensure the quality of learning. Prime school delivers a student-centered approach in order to combat the one-size-fits-all as a means of learning.In Portugal the educational model is centralized, therefore public schools cannot manage the curriculum. While in Prime School, an International private school follows the Cambridge curriculum and it possesses a certain degree of autonomy to adapt the curriculum according to the student's capacities and desires. For the reasons presented above, the Pedagogical Director of Prime School, Edite Reina, makes quality education and inclusion a priority for 21st-century students, in accordance with the UN SDGs 2030.The school of the 21st century questions its place as a space for the construction of knowledge. The reflection on the demands and urgencies of compulsory schooling of twelve years in a liquid world, in constant change, announces a paradigm transformation about school success. Teaching in the middle of the digital age contributes to creating ""never-before-seen opportunities to make teaching a passionate and motivating profession that makes a difference for a future society. Such opportunities are related to new roles, new content and new teaching and learning methods"".  From the most recently produced reflections, new goals were announced, skills to be acquired by students - the 4 C's (critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity) gave way to 6 C's - critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration, citizenship, personality (Fullan & Geoff Scott, 2014).In 2009, the European Council established a strategic framework for European cooperation in the field of Education and training, agreeing, by 2020:Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality. Improve the quality and effectiveness of Education and training.Promote equality, social cohesion, and active citizenship. Encourage creativity and innovation, including the entrepreneurial spirit, at all levels of Education and training.The document stresses that lifelong learning should be considered a fundamental principle.

The prevalence of project-based learning (PBL) has increased significantly, contributing to serious studies that concluded that PBL promotes lifelong learning skills, authentic knowledge and increases adaptability. A significant relation was found between the PBL method and collaborative learning, disciplinary subject learning, iterative learning, and authentic learning, which, in turn, produced student engagement. The results show that the PBL technique improves student engagement by enabling knowledge and information sharing and discussion. Thus, the PBL approach is highly recommended for educational use by students and should be encouraged in universities.Prime School integrates PBL through the Career ProgrammesBy bringing real-life context and technology to the curriculum through a PBL approach, students are encouraged to become independent workers, critical thinkers, and lifelong learners. Teachers can communicate with administrators, exchange ideas with other teachers and subject-area experts, and communicate with parents, all the while breaking down invisible barriers such as isolation of the classroom, fear of embarking on an unfamiliar process, and lack of assurances of success. PBL is not just a way of learning, it is a way of working together. If students learn to take responsibility for their own learning, they will form the basis for the way they will work with others in their adult lives.Prime school believes that the old-school model of passively acquiring information and reciting them out of context is no longer adequate to prepare kids for today&#39;s society.

What do they want to do for the rest of their lives?  Amanda Costa Santos   This decision does not come easy.Some follow in the paths of their parents, while others pursue a passion they have had since they were kids. However, for most, once school ends, they are lost as to what to do next. I, myself, want to become a pilot, however, my dream has always been to get a degree. I have always liked business and interacting with people so a degree in business management seemed rather fitting to me, although I already decided this some years ago. How do you know what subjects to choose? Which university to go to, if one at all? Prime School provides a unique method for solving this problem. They provide practical classes which aim to help students explore their passions and witness a small part of what it is like to pursue a particular career. For example, their Aviation Career Program strives to demonstrate to students what it is like to be a pilot; the kinds of knowledge and skills they would need as well as actual flying lessons on their full-motion simulator. Students learn more of what life is like in a particular career field rather than actually learning the material of said career. In IT and Robotics career classes, you will invent, innovate and problem-solve.In marketing, you will discover a new way of selling and analyzing products and businesses. These are just a few career classes to name. Prime School’s aim is to help students achieve their full potential and provide them with the best start to their career life. Life can be daunting, especially when you are deciding on your future, however having support and guidance regarding your future can provide a world of peace.      How can parents become more involved in their children's education?

Amanda Costa Santos    Learn how to help your child learn effectively at homeAnyone with children knows that their study time exceeds the time they spend in school. Having time to do homework, prepare speeches and assignments. In these situations, it is very important that children and teenagers can count on the company of their parents, but many people still do not know how to help their children to learn.Many people think that it is enough to let their children do their homework and then ask them if they do it, but in most cases, this is not enough. Whether it's a distraction, lack of engagement, lack of understanding, or any cognitive problem, we need to be more attentive to this issue. Closer monitoring - especially for young children - is needed to encourage and foster effective learning and learning.Many factors affect children's learning. Therefore, we have prepared some tips on what parents can do to promote an effective experience for their children during their studies. Follow-up!How can you help children to learn?You can take different actions and interventions to help. They range from modifying the learning space to more active attention to school activities. You should consider that each case is unique and the age of the child is an important factor in determining how to act.Below are some guidelines to help you start this journey with your child:Create a suitable learning environmentIt is very important that your child has sufficient learning space without being disturbed by the environment. In this regard, pay attention to whether the space he uses for activities has the following features:good lightinggood ventilationspace for books and notebooksfurniture of an appropriate sizea comfortable chair that helps maintain good posturesilence and privacy (especially for older people).In addition, working with him keeps the place organised and the materials he needs are still at hand. You can encourage him to organise and decorate the space himself, making it a pleasant environment that he enjoys.Make a study planTo develop study habits, regularity is essential. Therefore, learning becomes a daily activity and does not need to be postponed or avoided until all the work and tasks pile up and become a burden.To that end, according to your child's daily activities, performance and the average amount of activity, work with your child to determine daily study time or study time - there is always a gap. At this point, it is important to consider the age of the child/teenager, knowing that younger children may stay focused for a shorter period of time than older ones.Also, be careful not to overload. It is important to have time off and rest every day, this does not necessarily interfere or prevent your child from focusing on learning. Talk to your child and develop a routine that includes all this time and is relevant to both of you.Ask your child what he has learnedEncourage your child to talk about what they are learning as this will help them better understand and memorise what they are studying. Instead of asking him to remember or giving automatic answers, ask thought-provoking questions, such as ""Why is that?"" And ""What do you think?"" If you master the topic, you can help him accordingly.In addition to these behaviors, also avoid answering for him. Even if he has knowledge of the content, ask him to examine books and notebooks to find what he needs - using the Internet as a last resort. If he can't find the answer and doesn't know either, encourage him to ask the class teacher the next day. If necessary, help them compose the question, so they still create more of a connection.Use technological resources to your advantageMany times the internet can be harmful to learning, due to distractions, but at other times it can be a great ally. We must know how to pass this concept to the child. There are several applications that provide tools to assist in their studies, in addition to numerous free search engines available.You can take the opportunity to talk to your child about the appropriate use of the Internet and the importance of searching for reliable sources. Especially if he is younger, try to first browse the internet with him and show him how to do a search, which sites and pages he should use and how he can verify the information found.If he is older, he may have more autonomy to use the internet on his own. However, make sure that, during study time, he is not distracted on other sites, or on social networks. This is common, and even we do it ourselves from time to time, but it can hinder concentration and the quality of the study.Be presentAs you may have realised by now, your presence is the most important factor in the whole process. The younger your child is, the more availability you need to have to accompany him/her on the learning path. Don't forget that it is important to show that you care about your child's learning and that you are there to answer questions and help whenever necessary.In addition, always try to promote a humanised education. Do not forget to praise the work well done and correct whatever you think is necessary, always in a kind way and without making unnecessary criticisms or scolding. This will make your child trust you and not hesitate to seek guidance when he/she needs it.Little by little and with time, as the activities adapt to your routine, things will get easier and they will create more autonomy, searching for their own way of studying. However, be sure to always follow up and supervise, even if more distant, and check what is being done.Finally, do not forget to educate by example. Hardly, parents who do not care about school and learning, or who do not give importance to education, will have children committed and interested in studying.We know that the education of children and adolescents is only possible when there is family participation. That is why it is so important that parents are available and participate in the formation of autonomous and intelligent adults.Now that you know how to help your child to study efficiently, follow us on social networks and get access to more content like this! Learn more     What is the importance of international education, and who benefits from it?

In these situations, it is very important that children and teenagers can count on the company of their parents, but many people still do not know how to help their children to learn.Many people think that it is enough to let their children do their homework and then ask them if they do it, but in most cases, this is not enough. Whether it's a distraction, lack of engagement, lack of understanding, or any cognitive problem, we need to be more attentive to this issue. Closer monitoring - especially for young children - is needed to encourage and foster effective learning and learning.Many factors affect children's learning. Therefore, we have prepared some tips on what parents can do to promote an effective experience for their children during their studies. Follow-up!How can you help children to learn?You can take different actions and interventions to help. They range from modifying the learning space to more active attention to school activities. You should consider that each case is unique and the age of the child is an important factor in determining how to act.Below are some guidelines to help you start this journey with your child:Create a suitable learning environmentIt is very important that your child has sufficient learning space without being disturbed by the environment. In this regard, pay attention to whether the space he uses for activities has the following features:good lightinggood ventilationspace for books and notebooksfurniture of an appropriate sizea comfortable chair that helps maintain good posturesilence and privacy (especially for older people).In addition, working with him keeps the place organised and the materials he needs are still at hand. You can encourage him to organise and decorate the space himself, making it a pleasant environment that he enjoys.Make a study planTo develop study habits, regularity is essential. Therefore, learning becomes a daily activity and does not need to be postponed or avoided until all the work and tasks pile up and become a burden.To that end, according to your child's daily activities, performance and the average amount of activity, work with your child to determine daily study time or study time - there is always a gap. At this point, it is important to consider the age of the child/teenager, knowing that younger children may stay focused for a shorter period of time than older ones.Also, be careful not to overload. It is important to have time off and rest every day, this does not necessarily interfere or prevent your child from focusing on learning. Talk to your child and develop a routine that includes all this time and is relevant to both of you.Ask your child what he has learnedEncourage your child to talk about what they are learning as this will help them better understand and memorise what they are studying. Instead of asking him to remember or giving automatic answers, ask thought-provoking questions, such as ""Why is that?"" And ""What do you think?"" If you master the topic, you can help him accordingly.In addition to these behaviors, also avoid answering for him. Even if he has knowledge of the content, ask him to examine books and notebooks to find what he needs - using the Internet as a last resort. If he can't find the answer and doesn't know either, encourage him to ask the class teacher the next day. If necessary, help them compose the question, so they still create more of a connection.Use technological resources to your advantageMany times the internet can be harmful to learning, due to distractions, but at other times it can be a great ally. We must know how to pass this concept to the child. There are several applications that provide tools to assist in their studies, in addition to numerous free search engines available.You can take the opportunity to talk to your child about the appropriate use of the Internet and the importance of searching for reliable sources. Especially if he is younger, try to first browse the internet with him and show him how to do a search, which sites and pages he should use and how he can verify the information found.If he is older, he may have more autonomy to use the internet on his own. However, make sure that, during study time, he is not distracted on other sites, or on social networks. This is common, and even we do it ourselves from time to time, but it can hinder concentration and the quality of the study.Be presentAs you may have realised by now, your presence is the most important factor in the whole process. The younger your child is, the more availability you need to have to accompany him/her on the learning path. Don't forget that it is important to show that you care about your child's learning and that you are there to answer questions and help whenever necessary.In addition, always try to promote a humanised education. Do not forget to praise the work well done and correct whatever you think is necessary, always in a kind way and without making unnecessary criticisms or scolding. This will make your child trust you and not hesitate to seek guidance when he/she needs it.Little by little and with time, as the activities adapt to your routine, things will get easier and they will create more autonomy, searching for their own way of studying. However, be sure to always follow up and supervise, even if more distant, and check what is being done.Finally, do not forget to educate by example. Hardly, parents who do not care about school and learning, or who do not give importance to education, will have children committed and interested in studying.We know that the education of children and adolescents is only possible when there is family participation. That is why it is so important that parents are available and participate in the formation of autonomous and intelligent adults.Now that you know how to help your child to study efficiently, follow us on social networks and get access to more content like this! Learn more     What is the importance of international education, and who benefits from it?

Only available in our Sintra Campus   Our Preschool program is filled with investigation, exploration, and discovery, to accommodate active and enthusiastic children, who seek to refine and expand their skills and knowledge. Thanks to specialized teaching practices, purposefully designed learning environments, and enriched activities, teachers ensure preschoolers have joyful, appropriate, and meaningful learning experiences, that lead to success in academia and professional life. Our preschool program goals and practices aim to fulfill families' expectations of educational excellence, helping young learners grow into confident students.  Preschoolers learn “pre-skills,” which lay the groundwork for the future. Through their playing, singing, and learning, preschoolers gain skills that ultimately help them learn to read, write, build their maths and science skills, and become successful students. Preschoolers also learn “school readiness” skills, which help them understand the routines of school, how to work in a group, and how to be students.     LANGUAGE WORKS     Our preschool programs and curriculum provide pupils with opportunities to integrate listening, speaking, early reading, and writing into daily activities. Preschoolers develop their literacy skills throughout the day, not only during scheduled “reading” time. Teachers use read-aloud as well as poems, songs, and rhymes to teach topics cross-curriculum, and classrooms are filled with signs and labeled objects, which help pupils make connections between objects and words, and words and letters.       MATHS COUNTS     Our preschool teachers create learning experiences that build mathematical skills and reasoning, so pupils can solve problems and use mathematics in real and meaningful ways. Daily preschool maths activities include learning numbers, practicing counting, creating and learning shapes, and working with calendars. In addition, playing with puzzles, building toys, blocks, and games help preschoolers practice and build maths skills as they count, manipulate objects, and work with different shapes and sizes.     ART SMART  Our preschool teachers nurture pupils' intrinsic artistic abilities and help them appreciate art in the broader world, by engaging them in varied creative activities.   SCIENCE ROCKS Throughout our preschool science curriculum, teachers carefully plan experiments that not only develop scientific skills but also nurture pupils' natural curiosity. The class will learn about a certain topic (for e.g.: water, weather, animals, plants, and nature) through the use of books, demonstrations with actual objects, exploration outdoors, or interactive activities. In addition, preschoolers are natural scientists as they play and explore the world around them with their inquisitive minds. They constantly experiment and learn as they play outside, explore natural objects, and play with toys such as clay, sandboxes, and water tables.          Note:Estoril Campus: Whole curriculum taught in EnglishSintra Campus: Bilingual curriculum (Portuguese and English)    Creative Ways of Teaching   SCIENCES  Investigating objects in a light box or in a light table; Predicting daily weather; Using microscopes and documenting observations through pictures and charts.

In these years of knowledge, our educators prioritize the learning and development of values ​​that allow young students to grow in a consolidated way, forming innovative and creative young people, with a general and individual conscience that allows them to be respected and respect others as well as the environment around them.  This phase translates into a hectic, exciting phase in which children develop and deepen what they learned in their first discoveries at school. This stage is dedicated to hands-on, where knowing how to do, knowing how to create, knowing how to produce, knowing how to contemplate, and knowing how to internalize what we build with care every day, allows us to grow in a sustained and happy way.  The objectives and practices of our primary education program have been defined over the last 20 years, due to the educational and pedagogical excellence, and above all, the affectionate friendship and commitment that the entire educational community involved in the learning of each student has always offered in a special way for everyone.   We offer children supportive learning environments and dynamic educational experiences that enable them to achieve academic success, gain knowledge in key subject areas, and develop personal responsibility and integrity. Our students learn skills that lay the foundation for the future. Through our projects, students learn the skills that ultimately help them learn to read, write, develop their math and science skills, and become successful students. Primary students also learn “school readiness” skills, which help them understand school routines, how to work in groups and how to be students.

The Pearson BTEC National Extended Diploma in Sport and Exercise Science is intended to be an Applied General qualification. It is for post-16 learners who want to continue their education through applied learning, and who aim to progress to higher education and ultimately to employment, possibly in the sport and exercise science sector. The qualification is wide-ranging and equivalent in size to three A Levels and has been designed as a full two-year study programme. Learners who wish to take this qualification will have successfully completed a Level 2 programme of study with GCSEs and potentially some vocational qualifications. What does this qualification cover? The content of this qualification has been developed in consultation with academics to ensure that it supports progression to higher education. Employers and professional bodies have also been involved and consulted to confirm that the content is appropriate and consistent with current practice for learners choosing to enter employment in the sport and exercise science sector. The qualification gives learners the knowledge, understanding, and skills that underpin the study of the sport and exercise science sector, and gives learners additional breadth and depth to prepare them fully for further study or training. This includes the opportunity for learners to choose several topics from a selection of options reflecting progression in sport and exercise science. Learners will study seven mandatory content areas: • Applied Research Methods in Sport and Exercise Science • Applied Sport and Exercise Psychology • Coaching for Performance and Fitness • Field and Laboratory-based Fitness Testing • Functional Anatomy • Nutrition for Sport and Exercise Performance • Sport and Exercise Physiology. As the mandatory content is equivalent in size to two A Levels, higher education representatives have confirmed that it is appropriate to allow learners to choose from a wide range of optional units in the final third of the qualification, so that they can explore their own choice of areas for further study. The optional units have been designed to support progression to sport and exercise science courses in higher education. The optional content areas include: • Biomechanics in Sport and Exercise Science • Research Project in Sport and Exercise Science • Physical Activity for Individual and Group-based Exercise • Sociocultural Issues in Sport and Exercise • Specialised Fitness Training • Sports Injury and Assessment • Sports Massage • Technology in Sport and Exercise Science.

Our school works swiftly and adapts to every context, which shows our dedication and works towards the future of these students. Not even a global pandemic stopped us to act and readjust to the current situation.The Impact Of Covid-19Our school nowadays delivers the classes in presence, however, if we have to go back to remote classes, we are more than prepared. This situation proved our efficiency and success to support our students and education system, in any situation. Before we got back to attending classes we organized the schools and buildings safely, developed teaching and learning in a way that can flourish within these conditions. Prime school recognizes the importance of supporting the teachers and training our professionals to perform at their best in these very difficult circumstances. This can only be achieved through outstanding levels of leadership both at school level and with our excellentteachers. Therefore we decided to invest in support four our professionals in this peculiar time. Prime School prepared the environment for students to conduct the formal examinations and assessments which are necessary to progress successfully to the next stages.Current SituationOur school nowadays delivers the classes in presence, however, if we have to go back to remote classes, we are more than prepared.

Such techniques are being used in Prime School, both inside and outside the school. Another side benefit has been the very direct involvement of parents in their children’s education, working together with the school. Online teaching and parental involvement are not new in our School.Formal Examinations & AssessmentsA further important dimension of this crisis has been the disruption to traditional examinations and assessment in a way which really is very difficult for some young people as they reach key decision points in their lives. In Prime School, we have opted for creativity and imagination. We allowed students to take their examinations in different ways, either at different times or by different means, i.e. through an online assessment.Supporting & Training TeachersTraining and support for teachers, including headteachers, is an extremely important element of making these changes work both in the immediate circumstances of this first wave of the COVID epidemic but also in any later stages and indeed in the permanent new reality which will dominate the future of school education. In Prime School, we believe that it is necessary to produce and make available high-quality online teaching resources for teachers, thus we prioritize teacher's continuous training.In tune with the status quo of a country plagued by COVID-19, and conscious of its responsibilities, PRIME SCHOOL INTERNATIONAL, a bilingual, private educational establishment, with over 600 children from approximately 60 nationalities, sought - and seeks - to play its part responsibly, having adopted the following measures:A Comprehensive Response Focused On The FutureThese measures need to be taken up and implemented in a comprehensive way. At Prime School, we believe that the future of education passes through adapting to new contexts and answering the world demands in the most astute way. The ICT revolution we have experienced throughout this century allowed us to implement and upgrade our education, our school firmly defends that preparing our students for the future is focusing on the future of technologies.How did Prime School manage to place all its routines online in record time? The answer has to be the Human factor - from a highly qualified team of teachers to an alert and perceptive Management. Prime School’s Management is made up of a team of engineers, with links to the European Space Agency (ESA) and General Staff Officers/Reserve Army Majors. The procedures adopted at the grassroots level within the establishment have the same discipline as those of a space agency or an army. United in the quest to win this war!

What is the importance of international education, and who benefits from it? PARENTS & CHILDREN  Amanda Costa Santos   Is International education a catalyst for leading change around the world?International schools, like Prime School International, traditionally cater to internationally mobile expatriate families, who work in international companies, foreign embassies and so on. However, local students can also attend the school, primarily to learn the language used as the medium of instruction there, namely English - the universal language that connects the globalised world.For those who are currently at Prime School International, they will automatically become part of a genuine and dynamic international community where they will have invaluable access to a wide range of cultures, beliefs, languages and perspectives.In addition to their studies and future working career, we must primarily also consider the academic atmosphere - always encouraging diversity and inclusion among students, teachers and family, i.e. the community as a whole.The Career Programmes on offer also make Prime School International unique, as your child's choice of career is probably what you are most concerned about. At this point in life, students may be more concerned about grades, friends, sports and other interests. Even though you may be thinking about these things, exploring a child's career is also an important part of their development. In the list of Career Programmes that are offered, we have Aviation, Business, Marketing, Animal Science, Several Sports, such as Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Golf, Tennis and others.In addition to this international and future career-focused atmosphere, we can also count on extracurricular activities different from ordinary schools, a greater concern for the environment and sustainability, a native teaching community, various cultural events (such as culture day, pyjamas day, Halloween, carnival, environment day and others) and trips, in addition to the Cambridge Diploma, which is recognised worldwide.In 2019, ISCResearch reported that the demand for access to international education is gradually increasing year on year.Education is at the forefront of global development and, with globalisation making it easier than ever for families to move abroad in search of work and study opportunities, it's easy to see the appeal of pursuing an international education these days.The demand for a 'western-style' education and the increasing prominence of the Cambridge assessment system means that the educational landscape is undergoing a progressive transformation.International education can be a form of cultural diplomacy. Employers are also interested in international education.Would you like to continue receiving more tips and information on education and family relationships? Subscribe to our newsletter and receive exclusive content directly to your email.Learn more   Are you concerned or do you feel guilty about not giving your child the amount of attention you feel they deserve?
